This software wouldn't have been possible without the existing open source resources available.  Additionally, in the creation of this app, many hours were spent on stackoverflow.com, so a special thanks to the members of that community that helped out.

## [Android/Sunflower](https://github.com/android/sunflower)

Google's Sunflower demo app was used as a boilerplate as development commenced on this project.  

## [chRyNaN/Chords](https://github.com/chRyNaN/chords)

chRyNaN's Chords library was used to display visual representations of each chord.  A special thanks to the developer for working with me on a bug that was found.
